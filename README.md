# Image Recognition GitHub Repository: Traffic Sign Recognition System

Welcome to our GitHub repository dedicated to the Traffic Sign Recognition System using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). This system is designed to enhance automated traffic sign recognition with high accuracy and efficiency.

## Repository Overview
This repository contains the complete codebase for the Traffic Sign Recognition System, documented in detail within our attached project report. The system employs advanced machine learning techniques, specifically leveraging the GTSRB dataset, to train and validate a robust CNN model.

## Installation and Running Instructions
1. Open the 'Process' Jupyter source file in a Jupyter Notebook environment.
2. Ensure the installation of all necessary packages as listed in the notebook's import section, with particular attention to `keras==2.3.1` and `tensorflow==2.0.0`.
3. Execute each cell sequentially from top to bottom to replicate the system's operations.
4. For model evaluation, follow the notebook instructions as the process mirrors that of `evaluation.py`, avoiding redundancy by not running the `evaluation.py` separately, which is designed for PyTorch.

## Data Requirement
The dataset utilized for training and testing is not included due to size constraints but is accessible online.

## Project Report
The project report detailing the development process, methodologies, experimental setup, results, and conclusions is included in this repository for comprehensive understanding and reference.
