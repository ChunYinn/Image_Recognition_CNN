Instruction to run my code:
1. Open the file 'Process' Jupyter source file in jupyter notebook
2. Before running the notebook, make sure to install all the necessary packages listed in the import section of the notebook. Specifically, ensure that you have keras==2.3.1 and tensorflow==2.0.0 installed, as these versions are required for the code to run correctly.
3. With the required packages installed, proceed to run each cell in the notebook sequentially, from top to bottom. This will execute the code in the correct order.
4. Note that for evalution part is same as evaluation.py where I test the accuracy of all class and overall accuracy of my best model. So don't run evaluation.py file as it run with pyTorch.
